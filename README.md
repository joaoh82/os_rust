The Polyglot Programmer OS in Rust
===
My own Operating System, just for fun.

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. 
> â€” Richard Feynman

## Requirements
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
*  Rust 1.52.0-nightly

## Important Notes

To create a bootable image we just need to hit one command which is:
```
> cargo bootimage
```

To run our bootable image we need to hit a command provided by QEMU which is:
```
> qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=bootimage-os_rust.bin
```
